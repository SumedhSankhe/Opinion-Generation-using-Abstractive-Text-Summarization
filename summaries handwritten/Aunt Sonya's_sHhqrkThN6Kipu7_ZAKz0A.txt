You had the best biscuits and gravy! <eos> I miss you. <eos> Now you're a back parking lot of a Hilton. <eos> :( <eos> The best chocolate chip pancakes I ever had in my life! <eos> My basketball teammates and I used to eat here all the time on Friday's before school, and it quickly became a tradition. <eos> You are greatly missed Aunt Sonya's, please come back! <eos> Very fond memories of breakfasts past.... :( you will be missed! <eos>


Summary: Great place to hangout. Must try biscuits and gravy, chocolate chip pancakes
