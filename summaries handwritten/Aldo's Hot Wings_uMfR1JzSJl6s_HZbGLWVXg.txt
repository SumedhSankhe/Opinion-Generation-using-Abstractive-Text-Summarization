This is our spot. 
<eos> We always order their wings. 
<eos> My fave is the honey hot. 
<eos> They have the best deal in Phoenix for wings. 
<eos> 50 wings for I believe 31.99. 
<eos> Tried the Mozzarella sticks they were good. 
<eos> Definitely will be ordering from them again. 
<eos> Great wings at a great price! 
<eos> The customer service is always quick and prompt oh and don't forget to try the potato skins 
<eos> La pizza buenísima  servicio rápido y muy tranquilo el lugar lo recomiendo para ir en familia <eos>
