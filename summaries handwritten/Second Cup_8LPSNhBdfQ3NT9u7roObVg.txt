Super friendly staff! <eos> Try their grilled sandwiches for lunch. <eos> You get a free coffee/tea with it. <eos> woot! <eos> :) <eos> Agreed ... super friendly staff. <eos> Owner is very nice as well. <eos> Think this location has been there for 20+ years. <eos> This location is closed as of March 11, 2016. <eos> Too bad! <eos> It was one of my regular coffee spots. <eos>


Summary: Nice staff and great service. Must try their grilled sandwich.
