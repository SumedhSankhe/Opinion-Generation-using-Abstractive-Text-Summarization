Great Hotdogs! <eos> Went there with my girlfriend cause we live nearby, will definitely be going again soon <eos> Looks like they have way more than just dogs! <eos> Nathan's hot dogs, Burgers, ribs, fish and chips and chili cheese fries. <eos> Also serves beer! <eos> I've been back twice since I found this place last week, and I'm planning to go back for lunch again tomorrow. <eos> The bacon one was easily the best hot dog I've ever had! <eos> The owner is a super nice guy- greets everyone personally when they come in, and when they leave. <eos> Definitely check this place out. <eos>


Summary: Best place to have fast food and great service. Must try bacon hot dog.
