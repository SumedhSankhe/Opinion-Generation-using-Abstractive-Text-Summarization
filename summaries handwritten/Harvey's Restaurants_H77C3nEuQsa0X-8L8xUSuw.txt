Amazingly competent Skip the Dishes order. <eos> Lots of order notes and requests that were perfectly followed. <eos> Thanks for making sure the Frings were full! <eos> Great Canadian, done well! <eos> This Harveys is at the entrance to the Home Depot there, but tastes just as good as any other Harveys location. <eos> I've eaten there ten or more times by now, and haven't been disappointed yet. <eos> I usually get a Great Canadian burger or a chicken burger, with their fries. <eos> At lunch time it can have long lineups, but so does every other fast food place at that time. <eos>


Summary: This place serves good food but has long linups. Must try chicken burger and fries.
