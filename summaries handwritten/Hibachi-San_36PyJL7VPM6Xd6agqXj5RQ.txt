Little hole in the wall but the sushi was amazing! 
<eos> and so different! <eos> I work at the mall and usually eat here on my lunch breaks. 
<eos> The food is pretty tasty, price for a two item plate is about $6-$7, and the service is decent. 
<eos> I'm not complaining :) <eos> Located in the food court at the Boulevard mall. 
<eos> I love this place! <eos> The have the most amazing terriyaki bowls. 
<eos> The bowls cost $5.89 and are plenty to fill even those with a pretty big appetite. 
<eos> I haven't really tasted any of the combos but they are priced between $6-$7. 
<eos> The only thing I don't like about it is the location. 
<eos> Must eat when at the mall! 
<eos> We even drive there once in a blue moon just for the food. <eos>


Summary: A 6 to 7 dollar meal which is good and located in a mall.
