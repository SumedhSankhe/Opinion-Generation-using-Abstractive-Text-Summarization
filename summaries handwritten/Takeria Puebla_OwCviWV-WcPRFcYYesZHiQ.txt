Excellent tacos and burritos!!!! <eos> Try them and you will fall in love with this place. <eos> Hole in the wall, with great food prepared

after you order. <eos> The carne asada burrito is awesome. <eos> I love the Tecate Quesadilla chicken or beef it's the best I've ever had, a bit pricey but worth it (it comes with alot of sour cream and guac so if you aren't a big fan get it on the side) <eos>


Summary: Excellent tacos, burritos and quesadilla  chicken. It is a bit costly though.
