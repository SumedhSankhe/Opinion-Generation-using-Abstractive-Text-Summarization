what a waste of time, 45 min wait for lunch it was cold and sucked. 
<eos> slow slow slow nasty cold food.i was very unsatisfied with the service and the wait time food was not cooked all the way and was cold. 
<eos> I suspect this place will be gone very soon. 
<eos> Don't waste your time and money. 
<eos> It's bad, unprofessional, and overall unpleasant. 
<eos> You will certainly be disappointed if you go there expecting to have a nice beer and something good to eat. <eos>


Summary: Dissappointing place which serves cold food after long wait time.
