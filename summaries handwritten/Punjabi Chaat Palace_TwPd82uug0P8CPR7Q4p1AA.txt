Ok place. <eos> They claim they are best reciewed on trip advisor, but i dont see why. 
<eos> The shop looks run down. 
<eos> They do not make anything fresh, everything from peas to masala is from box or packet. 
<eos> They simply mix stuff up, charge 500% more and sell it. 
<eos> I dont think i can say with confidence that i will return here again. 
<eos> Excellent Chaat Papri and Bhel Puri. <eos> Very authentic street food. 
<eos> Definitely be back. <eos> Sparse on the inside but the fun is to stand on the street and eat. 
<eos> I ate Overpriced Pani Puri which tasted ok. <eos> The boiled potato seemed to be stale. 
<eos> One should ask the price first and then only eat because prices vary from person to person. 
<eos> you can also bargain. <eos>


Summary: Overpriced eatry which serve decent chats.
