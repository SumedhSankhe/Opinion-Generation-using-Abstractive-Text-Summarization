Ordered the #1 without the fried egg. <eos> The meat was seasoned, slightly too much mayo, but.... <eos> The fries were fresh, the lemonade was smacking and the service was quick, professional and easy. <eos> Good stuff! <eos> Fye, fye, fye, fye, fye. <eos> It was was marginal. <eos> I got a steak burger and it was dried out and was more like jerky. <eos> Baked potato was alright though <eos> Great spot to satisfy your craving for a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. <eos> Also I loved the house made French fries and scratch lemonade. <eos> Keep up the good work guys ! <eos>



Summary: Good food and quick service. Must  try steak burger, french fries and scratch lemonade.
