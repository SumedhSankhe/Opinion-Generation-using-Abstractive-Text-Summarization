Had my son's birthday party there had 12 people come to the party everybody was very disppointed with the service. 
<eos> I asked several times for the waitress to clear the table and she just ignored me. 
<eos> Food was average at best, would not recommend this place to anyone. 
<eos> Found out today that they are going out of business yahhh they fucking suck dog shit.. 
<eos> Bo0o0o0o00o0o. <eos> NPC blows. 
<eos> Asshole bartenders, slow service, nice if you like to overpay or like the dirty feeling of being raped in the bum. 
<eos> Ok, so I gave one additional star since Spinelli had her birthday there 
<eos> I've been here twice, I think the service is iffy. 
<eos> I do like the food, but I'd rather go to Dave and Busters <eos>


Summary: Do not have your party unless you want to ruin and be dissappointed.
