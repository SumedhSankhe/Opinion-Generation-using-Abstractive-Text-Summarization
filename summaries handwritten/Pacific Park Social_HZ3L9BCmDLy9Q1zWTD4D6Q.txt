I would call this place Pacific Park Unsocial. 
<eos> No one acknowledged me when I came in and then they went on to serve someone who came in after me. 
<eos> So I left. 
<eos> I really dig the food here. 
<eos> Panninis are classic, coffee is on point. 
<eos> $11 for a proscuitto panini with one slice of proscuitto...the same for my wife who had a mortadello panini. 
<eos> The ingredients were great almost non-existent. 
<eos> We expected alot more from a $11 sandwich. <eos>


Summary: An unsocial place which serves on point Panninis.
