I'm not often in this area but I had to try based on a good friend's recommendation. 
<eos> It was great, the food was perfect. 
<eos> I ordered the mixed platter so we tried everything. 
<eos> Freshly cooked on the coals made the meats tasty. 
<eos> I would come back, very good in this area. 
<eos> Great Grilled meat! 
<eos> Love the coriander sauce! 
<eos> Very good Afghan food. 
<eos> Very nice grilled meet.
<eos> Good price. 
<eos> Will definitely go back. 
<eos> Does also take out. <eos>


Summary: A great place in the area which serves tasty meat.
