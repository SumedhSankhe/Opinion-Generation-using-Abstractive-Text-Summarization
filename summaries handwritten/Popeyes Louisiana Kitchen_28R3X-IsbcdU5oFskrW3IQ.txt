I have to say that the staff here are very nice and friendly. 
<eos> Props to the owner to make it a great working environment for the staff. 
<eos> Best popeyes friendly staff service is always really quick and owner is always around to chat with 
<eos> Good, thoughtful, and polite service. <eos> Fresh and delicious chicken even late at night near closing time. 
<eos> They were out of gravy for the mashed but that's not terrible. 
<eos> Just went here today, very good and fresh food. 
<eos> Amazing biscuits, and tenders. <eos> Popeyes never disappoints. <eos>


Summary: Quick service and very friendly staff and serve delicious food.
