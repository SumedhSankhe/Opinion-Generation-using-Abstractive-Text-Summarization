Their chicken burgers suck. <eos> Tasted like no name brand you get at no frills. <eos> Fake chicken. <eos> I love this place.the prices are very good and they have all day breakfast from $3.99 for Bacon,3egg ,toast and home fries. <eos> It's amazing! <eos> ! <eos> It's ok. Would be better if they had servers and didn't make you order at the counter. <eos>



Summary: Bad chicken burgers but good bacon, egg and fries. Service is ok
