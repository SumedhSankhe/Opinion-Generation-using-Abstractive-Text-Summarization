This place is a hit or miss... 
<eos> I paid for 8 pieces of chicken and only got 7 pieces by the time I checked at home. 
<eos> Also, the server says he gave 3 white pieces when in fact there were only 2 white pieces found. 
<eos> I recommend dining in at this location otherwise make sure you double check your order before leaving this location. 
<eos> Extremely fast, nice service and quality is amazing. 
<eos> Not greasy, not stingy with portions and very friendly! 
<eos> The place is pretty clean. 
<eos> The server was really fast, but I found it kind of rude. 
<eos> The deep chicken breast in the crunchy batter with the spice was amazing though. 
<eos> And the price was reasonable. 
<eos> Not bad since it is close to where I like to hang out. <eos>


Summary: A fast paced service with good food sums up this place.
