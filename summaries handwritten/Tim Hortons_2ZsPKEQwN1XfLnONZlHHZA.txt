Excellent coffee and fresh muffins beat Tims around. 
<eos> It's busy so you have to wait. 
<eos> It well worth it! <eos> ! 
<eos> This is the only Tim Hortons I know that doesn't automatically include napkins for your drive thru order AND when you order a combo forgets to give you your drink <eos> Slowest drive through time ever! <eos> always messes my order up:( and they over cook the chocolate chip cookie so it's hard and the Nutella croissant barely has anything in it ! <eos> ! <eos>


Summary: A busy drivethrough which has a very slow service.
