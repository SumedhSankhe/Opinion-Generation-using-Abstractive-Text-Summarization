I go to this place several times during the week. <eos> The girls know me and my order. <eos> Great location. <eos> While I was waiting for painfully slow service, the manager or owner came in the front door and berated an employee in front of customers...not cool. <eos> That combined with service as slow as mollases made my decission to leave this place and never return a real easy one. <eos> Typical subway, but open 24 hours which is great. <eos> Seems clean and the staff have been good. <eos> Best Subway joint in the area. <eos> Great service, generous toppings, open 24 hours. <eos>



Summary: This place is open 24 hours and located in a great location. Services are slow.
