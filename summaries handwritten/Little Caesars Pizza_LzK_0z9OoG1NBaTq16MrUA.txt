$5 Hot and Ready right around the corner from my house. 
<eos> Love it. 
<eos> Can you try to cut a pizza evenly and all the way through. 
<eos> Kinda welcoming. 
<eos> Took and ate anyway because I got Father's Day to myself 
<eos> Grab a $5 pizza to go when I'm not sure if I want to cook or not. 
<eos> I only had one instance to where they gave me a sausage pizza instead of a pepperoni. 
<eos> I now check to make sure I get the right pizza before leaving the parking lot. <eos>


Summary: A $5 pizza place you can try when you want a quick bite.
