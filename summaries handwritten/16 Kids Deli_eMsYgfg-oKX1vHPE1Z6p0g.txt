Today was my first day here at 16 kids deli. 
<eos> The food was great. 
<eos> I am pretty picky and the girls got it just right. 
<eos> Not to mention they are all very friendly. 
<eos> One of the workers was outside grilling, it smelled amazing. 
<eos> He was also very nice :). 
<eos> I will definitely go back again. <eos> Can't wait to try something else! 
<eos> Every time I come in here I feel at home. <eos> Everyone says hi and is extremely nice. 
<eos> Not to mention the food and coffee is the best in town. 
<eos> Love this business and recommend it to anyone and everyone 
<eos> A tasty, little local deli hidden in a gas station! 
<eos> Don't be fooled though, it's not gas-station food. 
<eos> The sandwiches are very good! <eos>


Summary: Small friendly business in a gas station with friendly staff and good food.
