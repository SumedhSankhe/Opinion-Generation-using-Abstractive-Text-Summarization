I love the waitress she was super cool and introduced us to our first chocolate covered pretzel shot. 
<eos> It was delicious. <eos> Cool pictures of airplane pilots. 
<eos> I also thought the airplane engine table was unique and interesting. 
<eos> Solid place , cheap drinks, deff make your way here before a show at BLK live. 
<eos> It'll save you monnnnneeeyyuyy 
<eos> We found a gem inside the Best Western Plus Thunderbird Suites. 
<eos> Lori's Silver Wings Grill has a great happy hour with good food. 
<eos> We were pleasantly surprised when we stayed in one night and headed to the lobby lounge and discovered this bar. 
<eos> Everyone was friendly, the drinks were very good and the wings and fries were fab! <eos> Who knew? <eos>


Summary: Great lovely waitress who are friendly and cool airplane picture interior.
