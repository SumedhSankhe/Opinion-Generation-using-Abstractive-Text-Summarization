Save money and order featured sandwich of month for $5 footlong.. <eos> This Subway location is ALWAYS out of sandwich stuff! <eos> I go here frequently as it's by my house but out of the last four trips, they've been out of what I wanted to order three separate times. <eos> Come on, your Subway, IT'S WHAT YOU DO! <eos> My friend and I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. <eos> We didnt  see the sign saying they opened at 8am.The manager was there early making platters for a party. <eos> She was nice and let us order. <eos> Store was clean and the bread was fresh. <eos>


Summary: This place is clean and serves fresh food.
