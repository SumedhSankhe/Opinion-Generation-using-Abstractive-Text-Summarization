I live right by this food lion and go to it often. <eos> Every time I shop I find something expired this took the cake how is a frozen pizza almost 4 months expired still on the shelves!!! <eos> ! <eos> Very nice store good customer service it's close to my house so I visit 1,2 times a day I love it <eos> I've never had an issue at this Food Lion location. <eos> I've always been able to find most of the items I've been looking for. <eos> The staff was helpful and friendly today. <eos> Although this isn't my usual Food Lion, I don't mind using this location from time to time. <eos>


Summary: Often serves expired food. Overall okay food and helpful staff.
