Coffee is not good. <eos> We prefer the kurig drip machine next to the OR over this place. <eos> It's gave up quality in the name of profits and now it's not attractive to the employees anymore. <eos> Selection of sandwiches and smoothies/coffee. <eos> very sweet smoothies, but they were ok. <eos> Small hospital cafe at Banner GOod Samaritan Medical Center. <eos> Stopped over there for a coffee and food. <eos> Had the Chicken soup, which was good. <eos> Also decent coffee. <eos> What impressed me was the politeness and staff at the cafe. <eos> Would highly recommend. <eos>


Summary: Bad coffee but good chicken soup. Staff is polite.
