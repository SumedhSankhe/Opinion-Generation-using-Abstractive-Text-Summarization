SOOOO Glad they came to Rantoul and wish them continued success as they have had all over the place! 
<eos> ! <eos> This is my favorite restaurant! <eos> The owner is very friendly and personable. 
<eos> The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. 
<eos> I am so excited that they opened one up in town, I sure complained enough to get them here. 
<eos> Subway can't even compare with them. <eos> Jimmy John's is the best! 
<eos> Ive have over 20 sandwiches at this place it was great when it 1st opened Now there getting sloppy. 
<eos> I had the Hunters Club Thursday night 8-2_2018 It smelled like tuna fish I should have not ate it , But I did eat half of it. 
<eos> Ive been puking and shitting for 21/2 days now. <eos> That's called food poison. <eos>


Summary: Local favourite restaurant with great service.
