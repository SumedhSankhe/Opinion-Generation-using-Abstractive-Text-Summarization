Ok pizza. <eos> I like Glass Nickel a little better, but this is pretty good. <eos> Great delivery service (fast). <eos> This is on Monona drive. <eos> The address on Yelp is their old address. <eos> These folks really care about their pizza. <eos> If you don't know subtle flavoring on a pizza, it's possible here. <eos> Try walking in to order your pizza--it's an education. <eos> Wonderful pizza at good prices. <eos> Ask for current specials. <eos> Yummy pizza varieties, especially the chicken bacon ranch. <eos> Monona Italian delivers deliciousness once again! <eos>



Summary: Great pizza and service at cheap price. Must try chicken bacon ranch pizza.
