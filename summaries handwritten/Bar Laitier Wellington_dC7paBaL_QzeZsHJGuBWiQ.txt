Just what Verdun needs. <eos> An icecream parlor that serves Baileys icecream dipping sauce! <eos> Super friendly staff and great ice cream choices! <eos> Would definitely ice cream here again <eos> This place is a Godsend during this heatwave. <eos> Air conditioned, friendly service, 30+ ice cream flavours including Green Tea and Rum Raisin and lots of chrome sided tables. <eos> I plan on coming here all week. <eos> Interact/Debit and cash only. <eos>



Summary: Great icecreams and friendly service. Must try Grean tea and Rum raisin flavours.
