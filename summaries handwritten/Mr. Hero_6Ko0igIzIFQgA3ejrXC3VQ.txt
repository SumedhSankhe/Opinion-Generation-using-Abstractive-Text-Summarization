Very nice and clean restaurant. 
<eos> Fast service. 
<eos> Very pleasant experience. 
<eos> Good quality food 
<eos> It's a Mr hero. 
<eos> You know exactly what the food is going to be like.
 <eos> stop here on my way by needing a quick lunch. 
 <eos> it is without a doubt the cleanest Mr hero I have ever seen. 
 <eos> People working there probably the owners were very nice. 
 <eos> 5 stars because if you have a Mr hero franchise you cannot do it better. 
 <eos> Your typical Mr. <eos> Hero, just much cleaner. 
 <eos> Depending on the night, you might wait a little for your order though. 
 <eos> They do get pretty busy. <eos> They do take call-in orders, however. 
 <eos> If you know what you want, I would definitely recommend calling ahead. <eos>


 Summary: A typical Mr.Hero which is very clean and provide good service.
