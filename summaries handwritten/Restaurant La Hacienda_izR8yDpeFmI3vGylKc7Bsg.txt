Been going here for 20 years - amazing authentic Mexican and great family run service! 
<eos> This place introduced me to mole sauce and I am forever grateful!
 <eos> This restaurant is a little out of the way but worth the trip (Van Horne and St. Urbain)  I used to live in Montreal and when I come back for a visit, I make sure to visit La Hacienda. 
 <eos> The guac is amazing and while I haven't tried many things on the menu, based on their mole sauce..I'm sold. <eos> A place to skip for sure! <eos> Food was tasteless and staff/service was horrible. <eos> We all felt like we were bothering the waitress. <eos> We ordered 6 meals and not one was flavorful. <eos> There are too many wonderful restaurants to choice from, this not being one! <eos>



 Summary: A place that just serves very good mole sauce.
