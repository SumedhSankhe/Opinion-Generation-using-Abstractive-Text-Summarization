OOB - Replaced with Bahia De Guaymas. 
<eos> Food was good, not the best or the worst ceviche. 
<eos> Friendly waitress, clean restaurant , and good size portions. 
<eos> My dad enjoyed his fish ceviche and pescado a la plancha. 
<eos> Flan was ok, think they get it from another restaurant came in a sealed tupperware. 
<eos> Bathrooms were clean and plenty of room to park. <eos> I was very impressed with Mariscos Culiacan! 
<eos> This AUTHENTIC Mexican food/seafood, not just another knock off Filibertos. 
<eos> I had a Pescado Entero (Whole Fish, Fried), and it was fantastic! 
<eos> My brother had the Carne Asada Plate, and I can say that the meat was actually grilled, not pan fried like so many places. 
<eos> I would highly recommend it! <eos>


Summary: A recomended Mexican resstaurant which serve great food.
