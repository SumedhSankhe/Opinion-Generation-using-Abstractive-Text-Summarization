I love tacos and this place was just ok!! <eos> Small location with food truck outside that prepares the food. <eos> This little food truck is amazing and have the best street tacos in Phoenix. <eos> The Chicken and Carne Asada tacos are my favorite items to order and the meat is always juicy and the onions and cilantro taste fresh. <eos> Salsa is pretty good too. <eos> This place is amazing! <eos> The food is fresh and delicious. <eos> I have eaten here several times and the food never stops amazing me. <eos> Can't beat a fresh homemade taco for the price they offer them for. <eos>


Summary: Serves great tacos but high price. Must try Chicken and Carne Asada tacos.
