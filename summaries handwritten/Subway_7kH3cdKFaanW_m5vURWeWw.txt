Looks like the lady ringing you up came from collecting money off the 17 and Indian school freeway exit. <eos> Dirty, hairy clothes and dirty hands. <eos> WOW -- What a clean subway and a very friendly staff. <eos> Oh, the veggie sandwich was great. <eos> This is my favorite Subway in the valley. <eos> It is near work and they know my sandwich. <eos> They are very friendly and I believe their sandwiches are better than other Subway locations. <eos> They do not skimp on the veggies and toast the bread just right. <eos> Try the Subway Melt toasted with pepper jack. <eos> Yumm. <eos>



Summary: Good sandwiches and freindly staff. Must try subway melt toasted with pepper jack.
