Worst pizza I have ever had. 
<eos> Dirty and with many bylaw infractions I am surprised to see they are still open. 
<eos> Also staff was rude. 
<eos> Top quality and price! 
<eos> The pizza is so heavy!! 
<eos> Fresh and delicious. 
<eos> I used to eat meat, and this was my go-to. 
<eos> Now as a vegetarian, this is my go-to. 
<eos> Our go to take-out pizza place when in the need for pizza. 
<eos> Fast and good quality food, with an excellent crust - never soggy or greasy. 
<eos> $2 for an extra pizza is great up grade and never turn this down. <eos>



Summary: Good pizza for meat and non meat eaters.
