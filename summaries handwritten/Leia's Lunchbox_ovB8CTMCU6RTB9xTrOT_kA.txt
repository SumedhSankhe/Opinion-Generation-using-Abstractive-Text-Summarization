CHEESECURDS WERE SO GOOD OMG.literally amazing go here for sure. 
<eos> The best cheese curds of all time 
<eos> fell in love with the bacon and bleu burger with the raspberry sauce. 
<eos> very great after a late night of studying on the way home from memorial library, or during a night out with friends when they are on state street! 
<eos> Outstanding cheese curds and mouth watering gourmet burgers, Leia's Lunchbox was incredible at the farmers' market. 
<eos> Cheese Curds have a moment of glory where they are hot, crispy, melted, and wonderful. 
<eos> At Leia's Lunchbox, you watch them pull them fresh from the fryer and hand them to you. 
<eos> And don't miss out on the cookie dough! <eos> Holy cow fried cookie dough was amazing! <eos>


Summary: Must try Cheese Curds, cookie dough and burger.
