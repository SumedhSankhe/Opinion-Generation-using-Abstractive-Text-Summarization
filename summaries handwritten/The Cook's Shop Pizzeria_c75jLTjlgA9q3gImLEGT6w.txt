I haven't been here in years, but they had the best pizza! <eos> My daughter and I would go there for a piece of pizza a nd soda special...nice owner too. <eos> No reviews? <eos> Does this place even still exist? <eos> I LOVED it when I was growing up in Green Valley. <eos> Sicilian breadsticks with artichoke hearts... mmm. <eos> Great pizza! <eos> this place does not exist and the number left above is a massage parlor.lol <eos>


Summary; Great pizza and nice owner.
