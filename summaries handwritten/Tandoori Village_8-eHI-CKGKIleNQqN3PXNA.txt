Worst place you can visit in your life. 
<eos> Went with my co-workers. 
<eos> They served rotten ghulab-jaban. 
<eos> Everything tastes bad. 
<eos> Great place for mainstream Indian curries! <eos> We love ordering take outs of butter chicken, lentils and veggie dishes. 
<eos> Food is fresh and place is run by a family so can't go wrong! <eos> Enjoyed the food! 
<eos> Beef biriyani, naan, goat curry, eggplant bhurta, butter chicken, paneer pakora. 
<eos> I will go back to this place again! <eos>


Summary: Indian restaurant that you can visit.
