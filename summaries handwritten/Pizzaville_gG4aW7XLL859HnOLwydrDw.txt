Can't cook a pizza. 
<eos> Can't deliver a pizza. 
<eos> Can't process a refund. 
<eos> Can't believe these jokers are able to keep their franchise. 
<eos> Terrible customer service befitting the dog food they try to pass as pizza. 
<eos> Lil corner spot to get a slice. <eos> Not a huge selection of slice options. 
<eos> I find Pizzaville tends to under serve the slice market. 
<eos> He told me to take what he has or to not bother him. <eos> Not my kind of place. 
<eos> It looked like it was made two days ago. <eos>


Summary: A place that cannot get anything right.
