Everything I have tried at Italian Garden has been great! 
<eos> I had lunch and dinner there many times! 
<eos> Their lunch specials are great for the price! 
<eos> The wraps are my favorite by far. 
<eos> Another thing that is always nice at restaurants is great staff! 
<eos> Chris, Rose and the gang are always very courteous and quick to help! 
<eos> Best hamburger I ever tasted lots of flavor bun was toasted . 
<eos> Service was great prices are good <eos> Order take out once a week and it's always great! 
<eos> Friendly staff and great pizza. 
<eos> Locally owned and operated with a menu that includes burgers and sandwiches that are all awesome! 
<eos> Best ranch dressing on the planet! <eos>


Summary: Friendly place that serves great lunch and snacks.
