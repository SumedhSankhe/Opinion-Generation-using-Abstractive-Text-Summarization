Good service, laid back atmosphere with friendly workers. 
<eos> Everything on the menu is cheap as it gets. 
<eos> Good place to go watch sports. 
<eos> Good breakfast. <eos> Price is right. 
<eos> Friendly atmosphere. <eos> The place is clean. 
<eos> The coffee sucks, but that's okay 
<eos> I get it, it's a dive but what place considers mashed potatoes an additional "a la carte" item for a hot roast beef sandwich. 
<eos> We have ordered the hot roast beef from here before and received potatoes. <eos> Too bad. <eos>


Summary: Friendly and laidback place to hangout and serves good food and cheap rates.
