Stay away from this place. <eos> I have gotten sick twice from eating here. <eos> When you order a slice of pizza they dont heat it up enough after it has been sitting around all day beacuse they are in such a rush to serve other people. <eos> The people who work there are misserable and the place is over all dirty and nasty <eos> My trustworthy pizza place whenever I want pizza for delivery, gotta love my Hawaiian and Meat Lovers! <eos> Nice to have a neighborhood pizzeria, quality is pretty consistent. <eos> I order mine thin crust and we'll done, deeper flavor that way. <eos>


Summary: Bad unhealthy food. Hawaiian and meat pizza are tasty
