Very small but the best sushi in town. 
<eos> I recommend to call them to place your order , they have a 20% discount for take away. 
<eos> For 2 people we often order the 32 pieces chef's choice combo. 
<eos> They also have bubble tea. <eos> Beau Bon pas trop Cher, c est un comptoir pour emporter et non un restaurant. 
<eos> Very good sushi. 
<eos> I order from here every time I crave sushi and don't feel like leaving the house. 
<eos> Also very reasonable prices. <eos>



Summary: A very good Sushi place to order for takeaway.
