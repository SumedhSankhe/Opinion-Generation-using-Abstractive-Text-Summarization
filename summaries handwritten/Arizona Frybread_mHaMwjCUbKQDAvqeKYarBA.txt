This place is great, when it's opened. <eos> I've driven there two times to find them closed 30 minuets early. <eos> When they close at 7pm anyways. <eos> STAY OPEN! <eos> I didn't think I'd like the food, I was blown away by how delcious and clean this place was <eos> The bread is amazing! <eos> But the chicken is prepackaged and frozen, tastes awful. <eos>


Summary: Clean place with good food. But it closes very early.
