The BBQ chicken bacon pizza is awesome.  
<eos> The bread sticks are so good as well I recommend this place. 
<eos> WORST customer service! 
<eos> Messed up my order and got yelled at and hung up on twice when I called to have it corrected. 
<eos> Never did get it fixed! 
<eos> Will never buy from here again! 
<eos> I have always had a good experience when ordering from this location. 
<eos> Pizza is always delivered earlier than expected, and nice and hot. <eos>


Summary: Messed up customer service with decent food.
