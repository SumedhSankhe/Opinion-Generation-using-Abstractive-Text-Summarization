<eos> Arrived earlier than 12. 
<eos> They were closed! 
<eos> It says on their entrance they're open until 1:00 
<eos> They close earlier than their posted hours by hanging up the phone about an hour before they close. 
<eos> Perhaps they get busy? 
<eos> Perhaps their phones get tired before quitting time? 
<eos> Either way be prepared order at least an hour plus before they close. <eos>
