This placed closed a while ago! 
<eos> When they were open, they had great happy hour hurricanes and deep fried pickles! 
<eos> Regular menu seemed overly pricey. <eos> Oh well...gone now! 
<eos> Good food, very good service. <eos> Gives one the feel of the south without going overboard... 
<eos> I tend to hang out in the bar area seating even when I go there to eat... decent menu, the calimari is good.... 
<eos> all i remember was ....food was sooooo goooood. <eos> the blackened fish is the BOMB!! <eos> ! <eos>


Summary: This restaurant served great food but is now closed.
