Under new mgt as of May 2015. <eos> Still reasonably-priced. <eos> Unassuming decor but better TVs, better seating/tables, evolving menu. <eos> I love em Saggy. <eos> Great dive bar but still not enough reason to go to the Eastside.. <eos> A nice relaxed step-up-from-a-dive-bar. <eos> The drinks were neither expensive or watered-down. <eos> Friendly crowd and nice bartenders. <eos> The bathroom was clean too. <eos> Hope they have karaoke again soon! <eos>


Summary: Great place to hangout and good food at cheap prices.
