Great food, great prices and very friendly staff. 
<eos> Bozena is the nicest person and always remembers us. 
<eos> She is an asset to this breakfast place for sure! 
<eos> Good basic food.. <eos> When the owner is not trying to hit on your girlfriend. 
<eos> I go to the bathroom and this guy is in my seat.. She was pretty creeped out. 
<eos> Got take out here, fried egg with cheese was good, tasty and big. 
<eos> Seating looked decent, they don't take credit card which was annoying as no one had a bank card. <eos> Staff was friendly and there. <eos>


Summary: Friendly staff with good food but do not accept credit cards.
