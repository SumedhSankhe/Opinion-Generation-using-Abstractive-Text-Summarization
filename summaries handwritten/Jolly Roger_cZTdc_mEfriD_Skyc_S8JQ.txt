The Jolly Roger will always hold a place in my heart. 
<eos> This was my dad's favorite pizza place, and I have a lot of fond memories of eating here with him. 
<eos> I was very sad to see it closed, but I'm holding out hope that it will one day reopen. 
<eos> The thin cracker crust pizza's were absolutely amazing, and I loved them so much, that I never tried anything else. 
<eos> Closed. <eos> Was very marginal its last few years. 
<eos> Poor service, even the thin-crust pizzas, which were the only things worth eating, started to slide badly. 
<eos> Awful place. <eos> Both food and ambience (what ambience? 
<eos> It's more like an old age home). 
<eos> I'm not surprised that they're closed. <eos>


Summary: Jolly Roger has a very good thin crust pizza but is now closed.
