Yelpers beware - the reason for the 3-star review is not due to food/service...it's due to the fact there is NO Pei Wei at 7676 E Pinnacle Peak Road in Scottsdale, AZ. 
<eos> We love Pei Wei, although we usually go to the one in Grayhawk, but this location is great too. 
<eos> I had kids menu, chicken teriyaki but I changed it to tofu instead and it come with vegetables, was delicious! 
<eos> Awesome food, awesome customer service, right around the block and super convenient to get to! <eos>


Summary: Located at a convenient location which serves decent food.
