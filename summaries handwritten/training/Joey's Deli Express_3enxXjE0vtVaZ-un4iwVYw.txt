The service I got was horrible and the food wasn't that great. 
<eos> The place was not very clean and had a musty smell. 
<eos> The food was horrible it tasted like it was two weeks old and tossed into the microwave and served to us. 
<eos> I will not being going back to this place! 
<eos> The decor of this place hasn't changed much since it used to be a Country Style but the quality sure has. 
<eos> I don't know how long it will last but I'm really pulling for them. 
<eos> This is probably one of Brampton's only real delis. 
<eos> It's the type of place where when you order a sandwich, you see them slice the meat for that sandwich right in front of you. 
<eos> Try the Montreal Smoked Meat, which is certainly a generous portion. <eos>


Summary: Bad food and horrible service and dull ambience sums up this place.
