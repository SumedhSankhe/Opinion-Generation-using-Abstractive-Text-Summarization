Came here for the Polish Boy and was not disappointed. 
<eos> Clean and friendly place but it's takeout only. 
<eos> There's no seating. <eos> Terrible Takeout. 
<eos> Wing Special was not special at all. 
<eos> Consisted of re-fried wings, oldslaw (not coleslaw) and white bread. 
<eos> Skip this place and go to Mt. <eos> Pleasant (consistently great) or Hot Sauce. 
<eos> Food taste decent. <eos> Only if my food was ready when I arrive, after I called in. 
<eos> Parking is great. <eos> Caution during evening hours! <eos>


Summary: A takeout place only which serves decent food.
