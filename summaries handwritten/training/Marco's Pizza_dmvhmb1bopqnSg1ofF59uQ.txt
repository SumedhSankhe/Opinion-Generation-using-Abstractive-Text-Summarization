Really good! 
<eos> My fianc√© and I ordered  a large cheese base with olives, sausage, and mushrooms, a bit longer wait for delivery than was quoted, but pizza was excellent. 
<eos> I love the thin crust, curtious and friendly staff. 
<eos> I usually stop when I am driving buy and get a pizza pretty fast. 
<eos> They have good pick up deals 
<eos> Not a bad pie when i can not make it to my favorite. 
<eos> staff ia courteous and always accomodate any special orders. <eos>


Summary: Really good pick up pizza place.
