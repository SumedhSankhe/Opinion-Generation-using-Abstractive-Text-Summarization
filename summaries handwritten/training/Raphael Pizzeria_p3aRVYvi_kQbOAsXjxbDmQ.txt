Just had the "All Dressed" pizza - fantastic. <eos> Can't wait to have it again! <eos> Love love love!!!! <eos> We just flew in from DC for it. <eos> I discovered this place a few years ago while visiting my daughter and now I have to order a pie every time I'm in town. <eos> The flavour and aroma is fantastic and the toppings are very generous. <eos> Beware, this pizza is addictive. <eos> I keep trying to figure out how to take it home on the plane. <eos> Best old school pizza ever!! <eos> Take-out or delivery. <eos> Located on the south shore. <eos> Worth the drive <eos>


Summary: Fantastic pizza and toppings. Must try All Dressed pizza.
