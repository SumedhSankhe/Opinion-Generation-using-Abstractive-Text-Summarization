This place is amazing! 
<eos> Great food, good prices, massive portions! 
<eos> Mac and Cheese is good, the bourbon chicken to die for and the fried rice you can't go wrong with!
<eos> My friend loves the mash potatoes and sweet and sour chicken! <eos> This is my all time favorite. 
<eos> The staff is so nice and know my order by heart. 
<eos> I've been getting food here since I was a kid, and it has always been soooo yummy! <eos> ! 
<eos> The bourbon chicken and rice is addictive! 
<eos> This place is the only reason I stop at the midway mall. <eos>


Summary: Great place to try bourbon chicken and rice.
