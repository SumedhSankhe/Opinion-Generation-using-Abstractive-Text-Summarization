Not good service when the restaurant is busy. 
<eos> The owner screams at his staff to hurry the customer along . 
<eos> Super good eats, very inexpensive. 
<eos> Overall service could be quicker but I disagree with some other reviewers that service is bad. 
<eos> Really glad this spot opened up so I no longer have to go to the Steeles location. 
<eos> The mutton is very spicy, and my favourite. 
<eos> Stale food and unhygienic environmnet. 
<eos> Stay away even if it is free. <eos>



Summary: Busy restaurant with very slow service.
