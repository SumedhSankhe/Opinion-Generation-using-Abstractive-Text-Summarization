By far our new favourite restaurant in Montreal! <eos> This place was a score to find. <eos> The food, the service, the atmosphere, everything was perfect. <eos> The chef Henry was amazing. <eos> They accommodated my young daughter with her order AND, the best Shirley Temple she has ever had, apparently!?! <eos> (hehe) Too good for me to have a taste! <eos> Save room for dessert. <eos> Absolutely the best crème brûlée I have ever had! <eos> We actually were so impressed with the whole experience, we went back a second and even a third time in the three weeks we were in Montreal. <eos> Each time, perfect service and top quality. <eos> (highly recommend the Mac and Cheese with Truffle) These guys are obviously all very passionate about what they do and it shows. <eos> I/we will definitely be back, and trust that Henry, Francis, Joe and all the amazing staff, will be smiling from success. <eos> Fantastic restaurant, and thank you all for the wonderful memories! <eos> À votre santé <eos>

Summary:
Bungalow seems like THE place to visit when in Montreal. Top quality food, service and ambience, so that's something I wouldn't want to miss.
