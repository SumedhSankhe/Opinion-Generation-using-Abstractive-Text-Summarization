A great, quaint little cafe in Lacolle. 
<eos> Friendly staff and yummy food. 
<eos> Note - not open on Sundays. 
<eos> Great lunch for all 8 of us. 
<eos> My daughter loved the house made chocolate cake. 
<eos> The owners were so very friendly. 
<eos> I had a great soup and sandwich and I could not resist ordering the apple cinnamon roll it was excellent. 
<eos> We stopped on our way back east from parc safari. 
<eos> Their chocolate mousse and Oreo cake looked excellent but there just wasn't room to try. 
<eos> Five stars for the food and the very friendly owners who make everything. 
<eos> Homemade average food for a great deal. 
<eos> Soup was good, panini was okay, dessert was yummy and all for under 10$ including a drink! <eos>


Summary: An excellent little place for desserts, definitely a five star rating.
