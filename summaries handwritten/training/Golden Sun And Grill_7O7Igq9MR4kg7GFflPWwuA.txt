When In Scarborough there is a small restaurant called golden sun. 
<eos> It's in a strip mall but the food is awesome. 
<eos> The portions are large and the prices are much less then you would expect to pay for quality food. 
<eos> Yelp please take this down this restuarant has not been here for multiple years. 
<eos> Thank You

Summary: Small restaurant with good quality and quantity food.
