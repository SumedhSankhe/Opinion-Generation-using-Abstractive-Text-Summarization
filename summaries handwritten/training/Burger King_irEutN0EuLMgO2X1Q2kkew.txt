3 stars because the facility was clean and new plus the service was acceptable. 
<eos> My crispy chicken wrap was not good. 
<eos> The chicken was hard, dry, cold and had no taste. 
<eos> This location is clean, modern and service is quick. 
<eos> will definitely roll in here when I am back in this area 
<eos> I had a great experience the lead supervisor Antoinette was a blessing she fixed my order when they got it wrong and she didn't charge me for extra food great excellent phenomenal customer service <eos>


Summary: Place worthy of stars for cleanliness and service.
