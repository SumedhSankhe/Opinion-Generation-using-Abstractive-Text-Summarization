Since the new management took over this place has been cleaner and more efficient. 
<eos> It's pretty much like any other Wendy's around but the service here is way better than most 
<eos> The service is disrespectful and disgusting.
 <eos> They didn't listen to a word I said and got our order wrong.
 <eos> The staff does not listen and do not care about anything but giggling with one another. 
 <eos> Avoid this location, theres plenty of other places around that are way better and the staff will actually treat you like a person. 
 <eos> I wish I could give them zero stars. 
 <eos> I enjoy comming here, usually very clean  except when the kids from the local catholic school dont clean up after themselves. 
 <eos> Food is always fresh and fries hot. <eos>


 Summary: The staff are very disrespectful and do not care, but the place is clean.
