I was pleasantly surprised with both the food and the service. 
<eos> Loved the panini plate I took! 
<eos> I mean, who would expect a fresh tomato salad with green pesto, olive oil, boconcini chese, and fresh basil leaf of top! 
<eos> The panini just melts in your mouth. 
<eos> Definitely a place to discover. 
<eos> The best panini in town! <eos> My salmon panini was delicious and even came with freshly made italian salad! <eos> Yum! <eos> Totally recommended! <eos> The place itself is quite cozy and plays good tunes! <eos> Great menu of coffee and sandwiches! <eos>


Summary: Restaurant serves the best panini in town and you will be surprised with the good quality and service.
