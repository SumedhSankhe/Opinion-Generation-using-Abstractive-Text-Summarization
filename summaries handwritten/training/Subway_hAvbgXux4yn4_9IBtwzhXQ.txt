Recent order for two 12 inch went flawlessly. <eos> They were busy and moved things along pleasantly. <eos> I used a coupon, got great food at a great price. <eos> Polite people work there so thank you! <eos> An average Subway. <eos> We have been there 4 or 5 times and found nothing to be inspired about nor did we walk away displeased. <eos> It's a Subway and I have got what I expected. <eos> Typical Subway fare. <eos> Food fine, bathrooms disgusting and in need of serious cleaning. <eos> Seeing this, I'm slightly concerned on what the "behind the curtain" food prep area is like. <eos>


Summary: Good food at cheap prices. The staff is polite but the place was dirty.
