It's a Taco Bell, so let's be real, they can't get more than 3/5 stars. <eos> The place was hardly clean for being there late night (the floors needed to be mopped) , but the food was served quickly. <eos> So, egh. <eos> Its your typical taco bell ...but

If you use the drive thru expect a heavy unpleasant odor..and the few times i've gone..they've gotten my order wrong..or took forever <eos> I went here through the drive thru last week and then this week I go for breakfast, and the signs are all taken off and the windows and doors a boarded up. <eos> It closed really quickly <eos>


Summary: The place was dirty and closes quickly. Service is fast.
