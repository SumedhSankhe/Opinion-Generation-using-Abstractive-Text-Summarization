This place rocks! <eos>  
Just don't try to come on Sunday. <eos> 
Very unfriendly staff, inquired about a military discount, which most chick fil a's that I have been to offer, and the woman just gave me a dirty look and said no. 
<eos> Didn't bother to ask a manager or anything, and it's usually just the police discount, which our military service members definitely (at least) deserve. <eos> Not going here anymore. <eos> 
Ahhhh sweet Century III Chick Fil A. <eos>


Summary: The place does not provide military discount and very unfriendly and rude staff.
