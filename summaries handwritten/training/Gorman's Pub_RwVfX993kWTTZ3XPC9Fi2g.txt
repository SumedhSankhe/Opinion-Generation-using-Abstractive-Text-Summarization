Luv it!! <eos> Best wings ever! 
<eos> I luv Gorman's after a rough day at work. 
<eos> Everyone  there is so friendly and welcoming. 
<eos> Jen is the best. <eos> It's a straight forward dive bar, good crowd. 
<eos> they also have a pretty nice deck that's fun to sit with friends on on a warm evening. 
<eos> WOW! <eos> What a great family owned pub. 
<eos> I met the owners and they took the time to talk to me and make sure everything was ok. 
<eos> They seem to know everyone who walks in and even though I'm not a big drinking bar person I felt right at  home. 
<eos> The prices where great too! <eos> Beware! <eos> Rude staff. <eos> Watered down drinks. 
<eos> Good for a sad beer on a bad night. <eos> Will not be returning with my friends. <eos>


Summary: A homely and welcoming place to have a beer and chill.
