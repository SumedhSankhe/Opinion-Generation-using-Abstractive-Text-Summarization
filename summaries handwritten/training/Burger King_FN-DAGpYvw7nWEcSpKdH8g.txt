Satisfactory burger king restaurant. 
<eos> Exactly what you would expect from a fast food chain restaurant. 
<eos> Ended up in Elyria after driving way past Cleveland, cuz I was tired. 
<eos> This Burger King was staffed with people and served food that later proved to be digestable. 
<eos> I didn't die, and the man with no teeth holding the door was polite and smelled of daisies. 
<eos> This Burger King will serve you a whopper jr at 7am and they will not complain about it! 
<eos> This is a night shift workers dream! <eos>


Summary: Burger King that serves exactly what you expect from a fast food chain
