grossest food experience in a long time,  the rice stank of cigarette ashes. 
<eos> Nasty! <eos> American Chinese food with 6 poor choices. 
<eos> The rest, hotdogs, fries, potatoes, spagetti, macaroni and cheese etc 

The toilets were absolutely filthy. 
<eos> Urine all over the floor and black mold growing in the urinals! <eos> How does the health dept let them get away with this. 
<eos> Don't ever order from here it's really shit food they should really consider getting a way better cook. 
<eos> No matter what you take it won't be good . <eos>


Summary: Never order from this filthy place.
