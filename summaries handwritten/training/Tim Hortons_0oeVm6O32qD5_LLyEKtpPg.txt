great Tim.hortons cafe in this area. 
<eos> love the pepermint dounut and latte. 
<eos> Highly recommed this cafe 
<eos> The service was questionable, we asked a question four times and they ignored us every time, but aside from that the coffee is really good with lots of variety, Iced,hot,sweet and non sweet. 
<eos> They have croissants and pastries as well as donuts to chose from and pair. 
<eos> Usually don't have items that are on their reader screens. 
<eos> Have been in far too many times only to be told "we don't have that" available. <eos> Staff are hit and miss...some are outstanding while others shouldn't be working with the public. 
<eos> I'll drive out of my way to avoid coming here, which says a lot for a Tim Hortons <eos>


Summary: A great cafe which serves great coffee, donuts and other drinks.
