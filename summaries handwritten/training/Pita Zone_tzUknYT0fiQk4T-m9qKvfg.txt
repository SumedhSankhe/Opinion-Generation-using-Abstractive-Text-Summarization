Food selection was good, but the pita was not served with enough meat in my opinion. 
<eos> I won't be back. <eos> Over priced. 
<eos> Average taste, and less than average service and atmosphere... Don't waste your time... 
<eos> decent food but not too friendly and they charge you what they want and not the price posted. 
<eos> They have a huge sign outside their store that plainly says any pita $5 and I went in Saturday around noon and was charged $11 for two and taxed for the over charge. <eos> Won't return! <eos>


Summary: The overpriced and average taste of food makes you not to revisit.
