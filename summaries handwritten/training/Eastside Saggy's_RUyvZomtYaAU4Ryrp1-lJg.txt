Under new mgt as of May 2015. 
<eos> Still reasonably-priced. 
<eos> Unassuming decor but better TVs, better seating/tables, evolving menu. 
<eos> I love em Saggy. 
<eos> Great dive bar but still not enough reason to go to the Eastside.. 
<eos> A nice relaxed step-up-from-a-dive-bar. 
<eos> The drinks were neither expensive or watered-down. 
<eos> Friendly crowd and nice bartenders. 
<eos> The bathroom was clean too. 
<eos> Hope they have karaoke again soon! <eos>


Summary: Reasonably priced restaurant with with good entertainment.
