Got what I believe was a violent case of food poisoning at bourbon street during Christmas shopping on 12/16/16. <eos> Enough said! <eos> Food court restaurant. <eos> The usual grilled chicken choices (bourbon, sesame, blackened, etc.) <eos> with vegetables. <eos> Chicken was OK, as was rice. <eos> No surprises, no disappointments. <eos> Great place to eat. <eos> Bourbon chicken is delicious.love to get the double meat double side portion. <eos>


Summary: Good chicken dishes but risk of food poisoning.
