Greek restaurant with the quintessential American breakfast. 
<eos> This place is that perfect little family owned small diner. 
<eos> Food is consistent, prices well, and friendly service. 
<eos> My favorite Breakfast and Lunch place in Charlotte where the food is downhome country cooking with a very friendly and helpfull staff. 
<eos> Good food, simple decor and good service. <eos> Old style Greek restaurant in the Charlotte tradition. 
<eos> Great Greek American Food. <eos> It's a dump but always terrific fresh food. <eos>


Summary: Great american breakfast place with friendly staff.
