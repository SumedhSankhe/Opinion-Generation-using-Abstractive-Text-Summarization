I wasn't too impressed with the food. 
<eos> It was okay but I've definitely had better Korean. 
<eos> I had the bento box and only liked a few items. 
<eos> Been eating here for 8 years and have seen the portions get smaller. 
<eos> The miso used to have tofu and seaweed, now half a bowl of powder soup. 
<eos> The chicken katsu box only has a slice of yam cut in three pieces, salad is just leafs of kale , used to have onions and carrots. 
<eos> No more mushrooms either. <eos> I still come here though as it's only resto on my street. 
<eos> It would be nice if owner asked once in a while if i enjoyed meal. 
<eos> If you're going to go, get the bibimbap, it's amazing. 
<eos> Been back multiple times and it's such a cute little treasure. <eos>


Summary: you can try other places which serve korean if you have a choice.
