Good quality food, some family ordered and picked up from here for takeout. 
<eos> I didn't see the place - only the food - but it was really tasty and good quality. 
<eos> Would recommend them for Chinese takeout. 
<eos> Friendly service and good food. 
<eos> Not too salty. 
<eos> Try their dumplings,  wings, chicken fried rice, shanghai noodle dishes - they are all good! 
<eos> I just did take out fried rice and dumpling and it was very tasty.
<eos> I will try other dishes next time I visit. <eos>



Summary: A recomended place for good chinese food takeout.
