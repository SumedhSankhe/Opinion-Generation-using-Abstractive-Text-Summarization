Not normally a subway person. <eos> But I had to check out the breakfast sandwich. <eos> Good value. <eos> Only $2.50 for a 6". <eos> Pre made egg but i had the option to get egg whites. <eos> But you get what you pay for. <eos> I'll be back. <eos> Do not go here if you want your sandwiches fast. <eos> This is the second time I've gone and they are sooooo slow! <eos> Just go down .25miles to Jimmy Johns, so much faster! <eos> ! <eos> Only one staff at dinner hours and chatting with customers in line and slowly making sandwich. <eos> No urgency to move the line. <eos>


Summary: Great sandwiches but slow service.
