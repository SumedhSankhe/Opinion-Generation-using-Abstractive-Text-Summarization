Just went tonight and walked in and the guy that was there was too busy making his own sandwich rather than at least saying "hello" and "i'll be with you shortly". <eos> Instead we stood there looking like fools for 5 minutes until the girl named Maggie came out to take our orders. <eos> Maggie was great but i'll be going to another establishment if this is the customer service I get. <eos> Friendly staff, clean bathrooms and new daily specials what more can you ask for. <eos> They are also super quick. <eos> Slow. <eos> Produce is not fresh. <eos> Found nats in my lettuce. <eos>


Summary: Friendly staff, clean bathrooms but food is not fresh. Service is ok.
