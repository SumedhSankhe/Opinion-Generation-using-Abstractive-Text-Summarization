If you're trying to meet weight for a fight I would highly recommend. <eos> I last 7 pounds within 30 minutes of devouring 3 slices of my over priced pie. <eos> Never again. <eos> I usually find their food greasy but not here. <eos> Great service, flexible with toppings, delivery price is cheap. <eos> Walk in pizzas done fast! <eos> Good food better than pizzapizza where me&bf had stomach ache after.although delivery was long... <eos>


Summary: Good pizza with cheap delivery. Little over priced.
