Last time I came here was 18 years ago and it still remains the same except the taco place is gone. <eos> Wish I can go sometime soon again! <eos> This place reminds me of my childhood. <eos> When visiting mi familia en Somerton it's always a must. <eos> I remember I could get a small raspado for $.25 back in the day. <eos> Their prices keep going up! <eos> Raspados are good but before we know it the prices will be crazy. <eos>


Summary: Nostalgic place to hangout. The prices are higher than past.
