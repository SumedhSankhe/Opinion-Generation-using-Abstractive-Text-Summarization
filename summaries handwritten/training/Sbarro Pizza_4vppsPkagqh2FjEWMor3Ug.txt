Greasy, over-priced, fast food, chain store...please...don't waste your money. 
<eos> Sbarro's is too greasy-the pizza that is. 
<eos> I enjoyed the salad and my friend liked the pasta that she got. 
<eos> I can only imagine how many calories are in a slice of their cheese pizza! 
<eos> Best and ONLY NYC style chain for delicious, thin, foldable, cheesy and greasy goodness!!! 
<eos> Not for the whiny Sicilian/dry sauce filled Chicago style pizza lovers that like to choke on a ton of dough! 
<eos> Wish Sbarro or a NEW chain like it had more locations! <eos>


Summary: Greasy pizza which is a total waste of money.
