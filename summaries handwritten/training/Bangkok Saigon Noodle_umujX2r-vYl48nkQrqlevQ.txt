We have been steady customers for 5+ years since we have moved into the  Bradford area. 
<eos> Great consistent quality of food at a fair price, well kept and quick wonderful service. 
<eos> The variety of menu options keep us happy. <eos> We would recommend this local small family run restaurant for lunch or diner, dine-in or take-out. 
<eos> Friendly service and fair prices but the food is a little inconsistent. 
<eos> I have eaten the same meal many times and it's always different. 
<eos> But when it's awesome it's amazing, hence why I keep shaking the dice lol lots of food to try, and worth a shot for sure. 
<eos> Great authentic Thai food. 
<eos> Priced very reasonable. 
<eos> Great service and friendly staff. 
<eos> Try a Singa beer. <eos>


Summary: Fairly priced restaurant which serves good food but not very consistant.
