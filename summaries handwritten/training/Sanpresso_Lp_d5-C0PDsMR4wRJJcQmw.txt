The sandwiches are actually decent as well as the prices but the owners are so bloody rude that it's not worth going. <eos> Thumbs down <eos> Nourriture épicée, mais bonne. <eos> Ambiance nulle (aucune). <eos> Service à la clientèle médiocre. <eos> Restaurant à éviter, voué à fermer sous peu. <eos> Delicious sandwiches! <eos> I tried the sausage. <eos> Our whole table was happy with our orders. <eos> The toppings are so tasty. <eos> If you don't like spicy food, ask for no peppers. <eos> Friendly staff. <eos> Can't wait to come back and try the coffee! <eos>



Summary: Okay food but rude owner. Staff are friendly.
