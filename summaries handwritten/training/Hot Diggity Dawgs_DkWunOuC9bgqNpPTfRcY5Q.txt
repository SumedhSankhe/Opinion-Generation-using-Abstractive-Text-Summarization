Great dogs and great service, I highly recommend you try it and I'm not just saying it because she's my daughters volleyball coach.. Lol <eos> Oh boy, the food is delicious! <eos> Great customer service. <eos> Not far from my home, so it's a quick drive there. <eos> Will definitely return! <eos> I recently moved here from Chicago so I'd like to think I know a thing or two about hot dogs. <eos> Came across Kim's place last month. <eos> Here dogs are phenomenal. <eos> They did not disappoint! <eos> I will definitely be back. <eos> I cannot recommend Hot Diggity Dawgs highly enough! <eos>



Summary: Delicious hotdogs and great service.
