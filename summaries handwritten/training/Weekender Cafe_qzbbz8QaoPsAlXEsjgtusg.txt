Good, cheap fry up. 
<eos> Ordered the 2 eggs special with bacon and home fries and toast for $5. 
<eos> Eggs were cooked properly and the staff were super friendly. 
<eos> Their menu is pretty large and he place was packed. 
<eos> Everyone else also seemed to be happy with their food (taking Pi tires, etc. <eos> ). 
<eos> My kids love the poutine and I love the BLT. 
<eos> Owners are always cheerful and appreciate your business. 
<eos> Its located inside the Stouffville country market food court. 
<eos> This is a great place to get a quick bite on weekends when shopping at the market. 
<eos> Breakfast items are cheap and plentiful. 
<eos> Service is friendly but takes a while at times. 
<eos> It does get quite busy on weekends during brunch hours <eos>


Summary: A busy packed place with good food at reasonable prices and good service.
