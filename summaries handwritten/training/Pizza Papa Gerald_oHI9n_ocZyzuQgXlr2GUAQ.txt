22 seats in the restaurant. <eos> 1 high chair for baby. <eos> Bilingual service. <eos> 10x better than stopping at McDonald's. <eos> Vegetarian mushroom gravy for the poutine if desired. <eos> "Made with love" the chef will happily tell you. <eos> So far we tried the gyro's and Poutine and couple of Pogo's, Everything was Amazing! <eos> Will definitely go back! <eos> Awesome pizza, VERY fresh toppings and fast friendly service. <eos> Most pizza is greasy, but this is filling yet fresh and healthy. <eos> Look forward to trying some of the other items on delivery! <eos>


Summary: Great pizza and bilingual service. Must try mushroom gravy pizza.
