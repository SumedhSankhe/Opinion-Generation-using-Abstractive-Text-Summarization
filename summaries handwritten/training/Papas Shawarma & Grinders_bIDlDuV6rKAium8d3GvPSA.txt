Panzerroti's are awesome, just a small place but you have to try it. 
<eos> Best shawrma in the area, definitely worth the trip to Bradford 
<eos> Great food at a great price. 
<eos> We do know our Lebanese food, as my husband is from there. 
<eos> So you can trust this review. 
<eos> The fresh cut fries are amazing! 
<eos> We had the chicken shawarma dinner and sandwich. 
<eos> Too bad the falafel was all gone. 
<eos> I found that the spices were toned down more for a Canadian palate. 
<eos> But it was still amazing. <eos> We will be back! <eos>


Summary: Very good shawrma place which serves some delicious food.
