Place which never disappoints you. 
<eos> Fantastic, authentic Indian food in Charlotte area at reasonable cost. 
<eos> Highly recommendable. 
<eos> Balu's Biryani is the best in town. 
<eos> The flavors are amazing and the spice is just right! 
<eos> The biryani is extremely fragrant and flavorful. 
<eos> Enough spice to keep you on your toes but not overwhelming. 
<eos> Chicken is always tender and tasty as well. 
<eos> Definitely worth trying as it will make you a repeat customer.

Summary: Recomended place for balanced spicy and flavourful Indian food
