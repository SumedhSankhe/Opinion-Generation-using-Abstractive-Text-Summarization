Awesome food, and you cannot beat the price! 
<eos> The guys at the shop have always been kind and speedy. 
<eos> I will defiantly be going back. 
<eos> The food here is fantastic. 
<eos> The gyro was fresh and made right in front of us. 
<eos> Friendly and reasonably priced. 
<eos> Will definitely come back here next time we are in town 
<eos> Hell yeah. <eos> Big beefy sandwiches tons of meat. 
<eos> My gyro was  legit. <eos> Real good cucumber sauce. 
<eos> Not expensive at all. <eos> Will be coming back <eos>


Summary: Great people and great food makes you come back to the restaurant.
