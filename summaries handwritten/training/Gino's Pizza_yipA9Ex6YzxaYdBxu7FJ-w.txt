Good Pizza and Wings. 
<eos> The food was delivered quick and it was piping hot! 
<eos> Why serve dry stale bread and charge full price?

<eos> I'd stay away from this. 
<eos> Halal Meat is served here. 
<eos> Ordered some take-out pizza + chicken wings today. 
<eos> Got the halal pepperoni and halal chicken pizzas. 
<eos> Both were good, but halal chicken pizza was better. 
<eos> The chicken wings were excellent.
