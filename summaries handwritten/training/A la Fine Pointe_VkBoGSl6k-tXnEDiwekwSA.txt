Decent food, friendly service, they were weekend slammed when we arrived, but once we got our order in the food came very quickly. <eos> Noting really on the menu for vegetarians outside of breakfast though. <eos> The food is good, I only go for the mashed potatoes for breakfast.... if you have two hours to spare waiting for coffee, food, a waitress or waiter.... <eos> A large cheap restaurant with various food on the prix fixe daily menu. <eos>



Summary: Good food at cheap prices. No options for vegetarians.
