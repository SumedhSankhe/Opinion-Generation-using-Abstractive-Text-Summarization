Bit overpriced. 
<eos> Ordered #3 veggie with tofu sandwich. 
<eos> Kale salad & pasta sides. <eos> Chocolate milk. 
<eos> $10 <eos> Everything I've tried here has been bland and tasteless.
<eos> It's all bread or all unsauced pasta salad. <eos> Healthy food doesn't have to be this boring.
<eos> Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere. <eos> I had their Miami bowl here a few weeks ago and I got food poisoning. 
<eos> I used to go there every other week, but I think they might have changed their personnel and not trained them properly for food storage (temperature). 
<eos> The alfalfa sprouts smelled funky. 
<eos> I was a regular, but after getting so sick and throwing up in my son's daycare later that afternoon, sadly, I will never go again. <eos>


Summary: Avoid going to this place as they serve toxic and bland food
