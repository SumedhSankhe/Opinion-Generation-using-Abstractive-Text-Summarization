I only checked yelp after I made reservations for the Ferris, and the tepid reviews here made me nervous. <eos> While I can see where some of the concerns people had come from, our experience was top notch. <eos> My fiance and I had a wonderful meal, with good service, and very attentive staff. <eos> It's definitely a place more for a special occasion. <eos> I had the special of the day, which was steak Oscar: a strip steak with crab, Bearnaise sauce, and asparagus. <eos> Its a personal favorite, and I loved it. <eos> My fiance had the Delmonico, which she loved. <eos> I felt it was a bit bland (a common complaint), but she enjoyed it. <eos> The salads featured fresh mixed greens, and the asparagus tried hard for being mid January. <eos> A tip is that if you want a more intimate evening, request a table in the side room, away from the TVs. <eos> There was a gas fireplace, and it was much more classy than the more sports bar atmosphere in the main room. <eos> Also the drink prices, at least on a Wednesday, were pretty reasonable. <eos>

Summary:
Looks like you can never go wrong with the "special of the day" at Ferris Steak House. Other food on the menu, not too sure. Could be worth one try.
