Avoid if at all possible. 
<eos> Not worth your time, $, or caloric intake. 
<eos> Make sure that they are Open first! 
<eos> Stopped by the day before Thanksgiving, the day after, and the day after that. 
<eos> Had to buy the Chicken Parm sandwich as my third choice, since my first two options they were out of! 
<eos> Not sure how long in this world this place will be here, I wish them the best 
<eos> I have literally never seen this place open and I live two blocks away. <eos>


Summary: Avoid this place as it is always closed.
