Pickle Bill's had always been my favorite go-to for lobster, but no more. <eos> We went there this past Friday to celebrate my fiancé's BIG promotion. <eos> Boy were we disappointed! <eos> The prices continue to increase but the menu never changes. <eos> We ordered a twin lobster tail dinner & a prime rib & shrimp skewer. <eos> Everything was served over cooked, including the lobster. <eos> I complained & received more over cooked lobster. <eos> I felt so bad for our server who was really great. <eos> I finally got up without letting my fiancé know what I was doing & found the manager for myself as no one was willing to assist me. <eos> She followed me back to my table to make certain she knew which table we were at but never came over to apologize. <eos> She comped the meal but an apology should have been included. <eos> We tipped our server very generously and paid for our drinks but left with a really bad taste in our mouths. <eos> It's such a shame but we will not be back for dinner... <eos>

Summary:
Pickle Bill's is probably well known for its Lobster, could be that they had a bad day. So may be worth one try.
