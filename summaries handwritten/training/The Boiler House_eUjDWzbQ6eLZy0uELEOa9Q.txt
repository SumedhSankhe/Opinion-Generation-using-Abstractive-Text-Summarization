This one's a bit of a toughie... <eos> The picture alone makes it look amazing. <eos> And it is, in terms of the decor, the architecture, the environment and the location, yet I'm torn about whether Boiler House deserves a great rating. <eos> Reason being; I've been there twice and had one good, and one not-so-good experience. <eos> The first time was for a light snack in the upstairs gallery during the Toronto Jazz Festival. <eos> The music and the atmosphere was great! <eos> However, the second time I was there I was disappointed. <eos> I ordered the veggie lasagna and it was meekly sub-par at best. <eos> The waiter wasn't very friendly and I was surprised at the service, considering my initial take on it. <eos> I think it is fair to say that The Boiler House is a great venue for parties and special events, but I'd have to try it a third time to truly give an opinion about it as a regular dining establishment. <eos> Maybe I caught them on a bad day? <eos> All in all, I'd recommend it and I hope to increase my rating soon! <eos>

Summary: 
I feel the Boiler House maybe a place worth trying out.
