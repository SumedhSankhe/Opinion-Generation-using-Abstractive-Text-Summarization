This location IS slammed at lunchtime! <eos> This was my friend "Danny B's" pick on this month's lunch time adventure. <eos> We arrived promptly at 11:30 AM and there was only two people in line! <eos> But listen up people by 11:40 the line swelled twice the size!! <eos> After getting our food we chose a high table by the window - overlooking Market Square - in order to people watch. <eos> There's plenty of outdoor patio seating available - in the event the indoor dining would fill up. <eos> I had the "Wrong Doug" steak packed with black beans, cheese, quac, salsa, lettuce. <eos> I usually get the salad or taco .. wanted to try something different. <eos> The Wrong Doug is packed with goodness and grilled on both sides and served warm..  it was delicious but too big for me..I couldn't finish it. <eos> By the time we left the garbage cans were overflowing and they ran out of ice at the beverage station. <eos> . <eos> this location does well at lunch time. <eos> It was a great lunch!! <eos> Thanks Moes ! <eos>

Summary:
Moe's Southwest seems like a good palce for wraps. It seems like a busy place so I'm guessing other snacks would be good too.
