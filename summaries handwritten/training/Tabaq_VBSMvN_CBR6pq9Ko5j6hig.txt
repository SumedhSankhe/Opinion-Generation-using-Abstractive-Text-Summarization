Excellent  Mutton Biryani at very good price. <eos> I go to the one in Mississauga (Dundas and Hurontario) at the food court - best Butter Chicken i have ever tasted. <eos> Amazing food and service, especially for takeout. <eos> Highly recommend if you're looking for

Pakistani food. <eos>


Summary: Great pakistani non veg food and awesome service.
