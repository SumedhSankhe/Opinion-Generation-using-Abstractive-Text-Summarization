It is hard to believe that this restaurant has been able to stay in business. <eos> The food was bland - the chips and salsa were not even good. <eos> The service was poor and the place was empty. <eos> Don't waste your money here. <eos> Authentic Mexican Food which is well served. <eos> C'mon, Yelp, update your information. <eos> This has been the extremely successful Burntwood Tavern for two years. <eos>



Summary: Bad food and poor service. Mexican food is served well
