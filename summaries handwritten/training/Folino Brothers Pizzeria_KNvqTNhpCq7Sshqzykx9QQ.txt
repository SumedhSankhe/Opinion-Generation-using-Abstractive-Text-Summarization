Good pizza and wings. <eos> Quick service and always a friendly staff! 
<eos> A bit pricey but very good pizza. 
<eos> If you live in the Upper St.Clair/Mt Lebo/Scott/Bridgeville area and you like Fiori's in Dormont, you'll love this place, as Folino's Bros pizza taste pretty similar to theirs. 
<eos> Name has changed to Nobbie's since last review was posted. 
<eos> Food has remained the same. <eos> Great local pizza place. 
<eos> If your into wings, I recommend the dry rub wings (ask for extra dry rub). <eos>


Summary: Nobbie's serve good pizza and wings.
