I dont want to give Auntie even a one star.. On a beautiful Saturday, my friends  wanted to go sit and have something to drink & have an app , or two. <eos> This is tops for happy hour places, that's why we chose it. <eos> We opted to sit at the bar outside.. All the tables were reserved for a shower. <eos> Every time we were spoken to.. bc no one manned the bar.. it was rudely. <eos> We got a cerveza and a marg.. at least those you cant really fail on. <eos> The salsa was horrid...& I usually love the Aunts salsa.. we ordered sopapillas.. asked to have them first.. Umm guess not.. <eos> THEY never arrived.. Our water ran empty.. our chips and not-so-much salsa ran out... <eos> THE end was when our nachos.. had a hair on top.. we told the curt waitress.. & she rolled her eyes and said sorry.. We never saw her again.. <eos> THE thing is.. <eos> I usually LOVE this place for it's patio and good food , but tonight .. .. <eos> I DONT think SO! <eos> I left with my appetite ruined. <eos>

Summary:
It appears to me that Aunt Chilada is not only bad at serving good food but even customer service. I definitely won't go a place like that.
