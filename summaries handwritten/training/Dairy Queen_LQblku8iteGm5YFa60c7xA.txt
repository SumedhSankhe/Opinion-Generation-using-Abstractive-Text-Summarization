Grabbing a quick bit to eat. <eos> Delicious all need dogs and a clean eating area. <eos> Looks good to me <eos> Your typical Dairy Queen. <eos> Food was average. <eos> Not a first choice for quality but for a quick bite. <eos> Stopped by to order a banana split, since they're having a discount on them. <eos> Great service, very friendly, but a tad bit on the slow side. <eos> Having one person doing everything is not a good strategy. <eos>



Summary: Average food and service and friendly staff. Need clean eating area.
