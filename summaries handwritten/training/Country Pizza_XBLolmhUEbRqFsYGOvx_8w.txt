Fantastic pizza

All fresh ingredients. <eos> They even make their pizza dough from scratch. <eos> Surprisingly low prices too! <eos> The pizza isn't anything to write home about but the guys and the service were nice. <eos> As I was later picking up they didn't mind <eos> I came across this pizzeria looking for someplace to eat. <eos> Very friendly and fast service. <eos> The pizza tasted great. <eos> I would definitely order from here again <eos>


Summary: Great pizza with cheap prices prepared from fresh ingredients. Friendy and fast service.
