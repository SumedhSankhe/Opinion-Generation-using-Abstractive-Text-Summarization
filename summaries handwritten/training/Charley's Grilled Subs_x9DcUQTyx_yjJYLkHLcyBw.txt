I go to charleys often its not busy so i am not sure why my order got messed up. 
<eos> Simple add mushrooms, onions and green peppers. 
<eos> When i went back i told the she asked if it was grilled in i said no and got handed a cup of onions. 
<eos> I'll be going to subway from now on! <eos> Get some people who speak English PLEASE! 
<eos> They gave me buffalo sauce instead of barbeque, didn't give me anything I asked for on my sandwich and gave me a strawberry lemonade when I clearly asked for blueberry. 
<eos> I have no problem with immigrants but y'all gotta speak English if your going to work in America! 
<eos> Great sandwiches and French fries Love their loaded fries <eos>


Summary: Eatry which cannot get their orders right and staff cannot speak english.
