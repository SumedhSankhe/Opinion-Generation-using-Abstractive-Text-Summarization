McDonald's is what's wrong with humans today. 
<eos> Childhood obesity is at an all-time high processed food  and a dirty environment go somewhere and find something healthy 
<eos> This place is always a mess, for as busy as this location is I typically only see 2 people working. 
<eos> It's probably faster to go to a sit down place. 
<eos> The people are friendly though. 
<eos> Cone machine never "broken"
Hot and spicys never over-mayo'd
All around v good 13/10 would recommend love y'all <eos>


Summary: Tasty junk food eatry which is understaffed.
