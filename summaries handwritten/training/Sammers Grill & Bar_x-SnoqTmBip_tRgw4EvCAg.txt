Great wings. <eos> Wife loved the honey BBQ and I had the sweet chili and Asian pacific ones. <eos> The AP wings were superb! <eos> Nice friendly folks. <eos> Gaming machines and sports tv's along with bar. <eos> Good solid food. <eos> More than just normal pub food. <eos> I was very impressed with the quality of food from Sammers. <eos> Many businesses have come and go in the spot, but I believe this one found the right combination. <eos> Friendly atmosphere, great burgers, and I loved the french fries. <eos> I highly recommend stopping in for lunch or dinner. <eos>


Summary:Good food, great place to hangout and friendly staff. Must try honey BBQ wings.
