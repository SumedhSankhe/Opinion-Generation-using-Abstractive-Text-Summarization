The food was fantabulous... great service and that's all you need ... i would go again <eos> Great little Mexican place with a full bar. <eos> Had a chicken fajita very fresh. <eos> They made guac tableside.... much better than the franchise alternatives. <eos> Would come again. <eos> Desert was also quite good. <eos> Great food, great atmosphere, great staff, and awesome margaritas. <eos> Best Mexican food I've had so far. <eos>


Summary: Great service and best mexican food. Must try chicken fajita.
