09/24/18- came in to get 3 orders 2 lettuce wraps and they ran out of lettuce and they took forever just to tell me they ran out and as I was ordering I had to repeat my self 4 times. <eos> Then I'm going Drive thru and I said ok give me my refund and she says if I can go inside to get the refund. <eos> No way I went Drive thru for a reason smh!! <eos> And then she tells me can you send him in my brother ummm NO! <eos> He don't work for you guys. <eos> It's fast food and I'm waiting longer then a restaurant takes I should have just gone to a restaurant 


Came to a driver threw gave me wrong drinks took my order wrong forgot to add a mean and then I tell her I need another one and she says we don't accept 100 dollar bills what are you talking about no where does it say you don't take hundred dollar bills. <eos> Then denisha says you can go to 7-Eleven and change it. <eos> Your kidding me I didn't go drive threw to get off 7 eleven to get you change!!!! <eos> Sorry you can't tell a real hundred from a fake one! <eos> So st <eos>

Summary:
Probably a place I will not go. If fast food is not FAST and yummy, then is it even fast food?
