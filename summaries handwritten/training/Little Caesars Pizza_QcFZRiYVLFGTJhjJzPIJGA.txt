Great new deep dish pizza! <eos> Love the crazy bread too! <eos> Hot and ready option makes this great for last mi ute get togethers! <eos> Terrible service. <eos> Terrible food. <eos> Low price for low quality. <eos> Avoid at all cost. <eos> Extreme warning do not purchase any food this store. <eos> Stay away - food poisoning. <eos> I really used to like Little Caesars. <eos> The pizza wasn't as greasy as Pizza Hut and I was happy to see one close by. <eos> I picked up a pizza here a few weeks ago and got food poisioning. <eos> Will not return! <eos> Stay away from Little Caesars. <eos>



Summary: Tasty pizza at low prices but may lead to food poisoning.
