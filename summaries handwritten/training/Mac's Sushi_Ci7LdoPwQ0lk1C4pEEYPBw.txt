The Best Sushi stand that I've ever been to. 
<eos> The food tastes like it came out of a Japanese restaurant and the manager there is such a joy to watch! 
<eos> Wouldn't accommodate a cucumber allergy. <eos> How hard is it to make a California roll without cucumber? 
<eos> Was utterly surprised on the quality of sushi that came from this mall. 
<eos> It was great to see sushi made infront of my eyes as you never know with raw fish. 
<eos> I was most surprised with the flavor. 
<eos> Flavored rice and fresh sushi go so well together, there isn't a sushi place around town that does this. 
<eos> Never the less if you are hungry want a quick bite to eat  ut know that you are getting your money's worth I recommend giving this place a try. <eos>


Summary: Authentic Japnese food stand which serve the best fresh sushi in town.
