Friendly, fast service, food always hits the spot! <eos> The salmon wrap is my all time favourite but that's a specialty item so they only have it certain times of the year. <eos> Their falafel wrap is also yummy! <eos> A good place for a quick lunch. <eos> Staff and friendly and courteous. <eos> What else do you need. <eos> I stopped going here after they topped my "Greek salad" with ONE olive. <eos> When I asked if I could have more than one olive I was told I could, for an extra price. <eos> Are you kidding? <eos> I was so irritated, that was my last meal there. <eos>



Summary: Freindly and fast service. Must try salmon wrap.
