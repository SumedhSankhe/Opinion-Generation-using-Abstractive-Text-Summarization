I'm not about this place at all. 
<eos> Ordered a couple medium pizzas and wings. 
<eos> The medium was like an extra small... with dinky little slices. 
<eos> The dough was burnt and the whole thing tasted off. 
<eos> They were all like that so kudos on consistency? 
<eos> Came here on a weekday for lunch. <eos> Pros:
- Fairly priced 
- Little bar stools to sit on
Cons:
- Breadsticks are stale <eos> Came here and got personal pizza,  it was very good, theres barely any seating like 3 stools <eos>


Summary: Small place which serves consistently serves bad food.
