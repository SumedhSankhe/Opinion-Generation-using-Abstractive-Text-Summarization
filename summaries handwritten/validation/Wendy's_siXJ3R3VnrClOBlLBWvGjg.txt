There is really nothing special that I can say about Wendy's. 
<eos> Perhaps it's worth noting that my experiences at this particular location included a very friendly staff member and a fresh tasting side salad. 
<eos> The value menu here is great, I also love the salads here as well. 
<eos> The service has always been friendly too. 
<eos> I  am not a fan of franchises but I really enjoy the food here. 
<eos> Avoid going when closing, got short changed on our french fries. 
<eos> Burgers were fresh off the grill. <eos>


Summary: Nothing special about the place except for friendly staff.
