The food really cannot called Szechuan style!!! <eos> The spicy cold noodle was the worst noodle that I never have. <eos> If you are from Szechuan area and you want the real spicy food, don't go:( <eos> It's so good!! <eos> The high quality food make me excited! <eos> I think everyone need to try it, <eos> This restaurant is really good. <eos> High quality of service. <eos> Food is cheap and delicious. <eos> The taste like being in the hometown. <eos> I like it so much and will come back soon. <eos> This is a good choice for you to have dinner or party in Las Vegas. <eos>


Summary: Noodles are worst. Overall food and service are good. Good place to have dinner or party.
