This is a small deli that I happenen into and tried both the potato salad (without egg) and the chicken salad. <eos> Both were delicious and I love to go here whenever I can. <eos> This is a great little deli with all of the staple foods of a traditional deli. <eos> Fresh soups, sandwiches and drinks as well as produce and small selection of grocery items are available at an extremely affordable price! <eos> Ask about specials daily. <eos> The only non-grocery store deli in Bellevue. <eos> It's a perfectly fine place to pick up a cheap hoagie--nothing too fancy. <eos>


Summary: Great place to have soups, sandwiches and drinks at cheap price. Must try potato salad and chicken salad.
