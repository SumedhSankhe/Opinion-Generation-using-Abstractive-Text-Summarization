No need to say anything it's 0. <eos> There is much better places in laval <eos> I ordered take out and i had chicken fingers with 12 French fries, yes 12 of them I counted them. <eos> They work really fast and slack off. <eos> Food an service were good except that I had a piece of plastic wrap in my coleslaw! <eos> ! <eos>


Summary: Careless service and bad food.
