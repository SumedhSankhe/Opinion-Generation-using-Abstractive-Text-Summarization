Food is just as terrible as their grammar. 
<eos> Once got chicken there and it was made from spoiled chicken. 
<eos> Their fries are terrible, imagine McDonalds fries but soggy and no flavour. 
<eos> Great late night food joint. <eos> Got the chicken tenders and biscuit combo with fries. 
<eos> The portions are great and the food came really fast from uber eats. 
<eos> Can't wait to order from here again! <eos> Good place for the price. 
<eos> Got the philly cheese steak and I would give it a 4 out of 5; good value! <eos>


Summary: Decent place for the price.
