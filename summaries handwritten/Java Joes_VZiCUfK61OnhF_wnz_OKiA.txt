Incredible food made in front of you. 
<eos> The toppings for sandwiches are super fresh! 
<eos> We come here 4 times a week. <eos> Average, pushy service. 
<eos> Didnt have enough change to give back, cream cheese is definitely not real cream cheese. 
<eos> Bagels were not fresh. <eos> Coffee tasted as if it bad been sitting out for a while. 
<eos> Not a great bagel experience. <eos> Lousy tasting coffee. 
<eos> Microwave egg and thin slice of ham on English muffin, no cheese .Couldn't eat egg or finish coffee. 
<eos> I did purchase fruit which was ok. <eos>


Summary: Good sandwich prepared fresh but everything else is bad.
