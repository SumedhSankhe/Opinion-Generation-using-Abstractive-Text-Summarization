Service was amazing. <eos> Purely Chinese run but still pretty good sushi. 
<eos> Their salad dressing is pretty good, not gingery like most places. 
<eos> The best thing is that this place opens late! 
<eos> I have tried Japanese food from all over. 
<eos> This place is quite good. <eos> Not only is the service quick and friendly here but the food is truely delightful. 
<eos> Its not a fast food place so, if you plan to go here take your time. 
<eos> Great for groups. 
<eos> Delish! <eos> Great Sushi and friendly Chef. 
<eos> Lovely price / performance. <eos>


Summary: Very good Japnese fast food which serves great sushi.
