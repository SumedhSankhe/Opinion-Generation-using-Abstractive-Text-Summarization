The 3 topping med (9$ ish w/ tax) and 3 topping large (11$ ish w/ tax) mon to weds special is worth it! <eos> pretty cheap and decent pizza, nothing mind blowing, but it get's the job done and the price is right! <eos> :) <eos> Good pizza! <eos> The slices are very big. <eos> You can get a drink, two slices and fries for 7,50$! <eos> The fries are super crunchy. <eos> Good pizza and I thought they didn't take Visa, but apparently they do now. <eos>
