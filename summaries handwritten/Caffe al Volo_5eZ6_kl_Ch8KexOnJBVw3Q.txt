Great Gelato friendly family run. 
<eos> All the things that make you smile and happy to patronize. 
<eos> A real tiny gelato shop out the side of the restaurant. 
<eos> If the gelato is this good we wouldn't hesitate to try the food. 
<eos> Absolutely fantastic food! <eos> Great beer, coffee, desert and most importantly food!
<eos> In a larger group, we tried the pastas and foccacinas and they were all delicious. 
<eos> The service was wonderful as well and I will be back many times over. 
<eos> Great little cafe with excellent coffee and pastries. 
<eos> Also can host upto 55 people for private functions. 
<eos> Located right in the middle of klienburg restaurant cafe alley. <eos>


Summary: A happy little gelato shop which serves great food.
